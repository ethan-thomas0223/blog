# This is my first post using the Jekyll framework.
The things that were new to me were
- Ruby, as I had issues with the installation
- Modifying a .yml file with a preset framework
- Not writing an index.html file itself

The things that I struggled with had only to do with installation and directories, but those got sorted out.
I did use [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) markdown cheat sheet for a refresher on some syntax though.

The things that I don't entirely understand have more to do with [lab 4](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyllmods.html)
and styling than anything else.

I am looking forward to learning how to appropriately/effectively use Jekyll.
