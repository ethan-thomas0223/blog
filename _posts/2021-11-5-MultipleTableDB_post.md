# This is my sixth post using the Jekyll framework.
The things that I found easy were:
- Page Creation
- Scaffolding
- Finding my errors

Tings I found difficult were:
- the select button, I was unalbe to get it working
- the last two steps as they are also unfinished
- sorting

I had issues after my page got scaffolded as I think that some files were left out of the scaffolding. This made me unable to complete the rest of the lab.  

However, I have learned from this and am ready to create a good product for Dr. Hill.
