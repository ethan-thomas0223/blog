# This is my seventh and final post using the Jekyll framework.

Collaborating with the members of my GIS Portfolio team and working with Dr. Hill was an invaluable experience. This project in particular has shown me that there are many people that have worked with large amounts of data and crafted something legible and tangible out of that data, but have nowhere to put/get it the way the computer science field has GitHub or Stack Overflow. The public issue of being able to store data and showcase the projects made from that data in one place for people across a given field per field does not really exist; besides Google, but Google doesn't quite encapsulate what GitHub does. Had out website been fully functional, that would have been the first step in creating a "GitHub" for each industry, something that would have proved incomprehensibly useful to students not just at Hendrix but globally. Attaching the Hendrix name to something that valuable would help the school as well as give more weight to a degree from Hendrix, even having a by department information reserve full would be helpful to henrix students and faculty alike for project references.    

The skills and talents most valuable to bring forth the change above that Dr. Hill wanted to begin to implement were those taught to us in csci340. Being able to construct a website that stores data were easily the most relevant as the internet has become the main pathway for information gathering, so being able to create something that housed GIS information was a necessity. Those skills and talents meshed well with what I am capable of learning and doing, however also I was limited by the knowledge that I had of the interfaces/frameworks that I knew how to use. The asp.net platform may not have been the way to go for us to be able to have the user upload files to the site and download a copy of those same files for themselves. However, I can grow my knowledge of what frameworks work best for a given project type, and the project suited me as I am used to having to work within a team from playing collegiate sports.

Based on working on the project, what I would challenge from class is the framework we were required to use. Being confined to asp.net razor pages ending up being much more of a hassle for us than what we would have liked. Our project required file upload/download that razor pages did not like a whole lot, so I would have challenged Dr. Goadrich to talk to us more about the issues surrounding file upload and download since that is often a major function of  a website, but we did not have a whole lot to call from when it came time to build the project. Hindsight being 20/20, that is what I would challenge, but you cannot prep for what every client might want.
