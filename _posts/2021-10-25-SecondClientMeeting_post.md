# This is my fifth post using the Jekyll framework.
The things that I have contributed to the second client meeting are:
- Creation and polishing of the mockup
- Presentation of the mockup to the class and client
- Asking clarifying questions to client

Personal Role in the project:
- I have been deemed a front end worker
- Assisted with clarifying Schema
- Able to assist with all project roles if the need arises

To be able to assist my team going forward, I need to continue to work on lab 8 and finish it up. This will provide me with the best understanding of VisualStudio and what it takes to work with multiple database tables.

I am looking forward to working on the client's website, and finally presenting something tangible.
