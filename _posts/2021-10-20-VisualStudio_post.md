# This is my fourth post using the Jekyll framework.
The things that have learned to do are:
- Create and Azure pages Web Page
- Add a search field to said Web Page
- Troubleshoot VisualStudio

The things that I struggled with had to do with adding code from the tutorial to my personal page. I overlooked things in the code from the tutorial that caused massive issues in my own code, as I wasn't paying close enough attention to the scaffolding. However, I figured it out and made good progress afterward.
I did not have any issues adding the search by team name after I discovered my own error.

The things that I don't entirely understand have more to do with [lab 8](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/ef.html)
and adding multiple tables to the database.

I am looking forward to working on the client's website, and finally presenting something tangible.
